# Getting Started with React

This project contains react starter code and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) wrapper for the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) css library.

Before starting the app, use the terminal and run in the project directory `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

Using the terminal, in the project directory, first run:

### `npm install`

Run it immediately after the project is fully cloned on your computer.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
